# bible.nvim
Bible reader-ish for Neovim

This plugin is meant to be a "what is this verse again?" sort of lookup plugin.

## Resource

This uses the API from https://scripture.api.bible and you need to also get an API from there.  For most the free API account should suffice unless you're treating this like a Bible study plugin (which it is not).
